# Objective: Predicting Car Prices

In Week 1, our goal was to predict car prices using various Linear Models in machine learning techniques. Here's a summary of our journey from Day 1 to Day 7:

- **Day 1**: We started with preliminary data exploration, understanding the dataset's structure,Preprocessing and initial model training using traditional machine learning algorithms.

- **Day 2**: We then implemented naive modeling techniques to establish a baseline performance.
  
- **Day 3**: Delved into feature engineering, creating new features from existing ones to capture more information and improve model performance.

- **Day 4**: Introduced regularization techniques to combat overfitting, ensuring that our models generalize well to unseen data.

- **Day 5**: Conducted error analysis to diagnose model performance and identify areas for improvement. Adjustments were made based on the analysis results to refine the models further.

- **Day 6**: Utilized ensemble methods, including bagging and boosting techniques, to enhance model performance by combining multiple models.

- **Day 7**: We also leveraged AutoML to streamline model selection and optimization, achieving predictions and metrics near to manual training.

By systematically progressing through preprocessing, naive modeling, feature engineering, regularization, error analysis, ensembling, and AutoML, we successfully developed a robust predictive model for car price estimation.
