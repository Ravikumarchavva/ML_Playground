## Introduction

Machine Learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. This repository contains a collection of weekly projects, experiments, and tutorials aimed at providing hands-on experience with various ML concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you will need to have Python and several libraries installed. The main libraries used in these projects are:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Polars
- Scikit-Learn
- Statsmodels
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into weekly directories, each focusing on a specific ML concept or project:

- **week1_regressionAnalysis/**: Contains notebooks and scripts related to regression analysis.
- **week2_Binaryclassification/**: Contains notebooks and scripts related to classification tasks.
- **week3_Timeseries/** Contains notebooks and scripts related to TimeSeries Tasks
- ... (Add more weeks are in progress)

## Usage

To run any of the notebooks or scripts, clone the repository and navigate to the appropriate directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ravikumarchavva/ML_Playground.git
cd ML_Playground
```

Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the desired weekâ€™s directory to start exploring:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
